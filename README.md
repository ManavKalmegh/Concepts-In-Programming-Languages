Here I have tried implementing ‘BigInt’ data type with operations (+, -, *) for supporting 1024 bit integers.
The implementation is done using array data structure.
The digits of the big integer (that exceeds normal integer size) are stored as elements of an array,
then the respective operations are performed on them using the pre defined arithmatics already available 
for normal integer data type.
